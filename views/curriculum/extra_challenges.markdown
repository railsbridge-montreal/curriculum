# Done quickly? Here are some extra challenges!

## Create different Suggestotrons for different categories

Just like votes `belong_to` a topic, topics can `belong_to` a category.

Practice your skills by using `rails generate` to create a scaffold for `categories`.



## Allow users to submit comments along with votes!

Migrations aren't just for scaffolds! Create a migration to add a text column to votes.


## Try some of the challenges from the Advanced class:

- [Make it pretty with Bootstrap!](/advanced/make_it_pretty)
- Do you speak JavaScript? [Use ajax](/advanced/inline_replying_with_ajax) to make Suggestotron snappier!
